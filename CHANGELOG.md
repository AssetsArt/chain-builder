## Migration Guide

### For Users

The public API remains largely the same, but you may need to update imports and version numbers:

```rust
// Old
use chain_builder::{ChainBuilder, Client, Select, WhereClauses, QueryCommon, JoinMethods};

// New (same, but better organized internally)
use chain_builder::{ChainBuilder, Client, Select, WhereClauses, QueryCommon, JoinMethods};
```

#### Version Update
```toml
# Old
chain-builder = "0.1.25"

# New
chain-builder = "1.0.0"
```

#### New Features Available
- SQLite support: `ChainBuilder::new(Client::Sqlite)`
- Advanced WHERE clauses: `where_ilike()`, `where_column()`, `where_exists()`
- HAVING clauses: `having()`, `having_between()`, `having_in()`
- Aggregate functions: `select_count()`, `select_sum()`, `select_avg()`, etc.
- Advanced JOINs: `full_outer_join()`, `cross_join()`, `join_using()`

### For Contributors

#### New Project Structure
- Core types are now in `src/types.rs`
- Main builder logic is in `src/builder.rs`
- Query functionality is organized in `src/query/` module
- Database-specific code remains in `src/mysql/` and `src/sqlite/` modules
- Common compilation logic is in `src/common/` module

#### Development Workflow
- Use feature flags for database-specific functionality
- Tests are organized by database type
- Common functionality is shared between database compilers

## Future Plans

### üöÄ Upcoming Features
